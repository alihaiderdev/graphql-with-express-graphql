typeDefs:
    The definition of our schema of what we can expect from queries and mutations.

Resolvers:
    Instead of the expectations of fields or required parameters, here we define the functions and behaviour of how should the queries and mutations would work.

Queries:
    The "gets" that we want to read from the server.

Mutations:
    Our requests that are going to affect any data that we have on our own server.
